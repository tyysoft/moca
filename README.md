# moca
Moca is a Mock Server base on TCP/IP, it's a useful tool for debuging some client.


  Simetiems we guys need to debug a client, maybe not base on HTTP protocol, so actually can not use the Moco server or some simulator base on HTTP...

How about this one?

  This 'moca' I want to build base on TCP, so if any other protocol base on TCP and not encrypted, it can be show there.
