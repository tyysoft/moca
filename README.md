# moca
Moca is a Mock Server base on TCP/UDP, it's a useful tool for debuging socket application.


Simetiems we guys need to debug a application in client or server mode, but the real client or server maybe not finished yet, so , we need a dummy one!

Like I write my Jmeter project, I always test it in local, use dummy server to receive the message, and then check the message right or not, it's more effective than check the project until the real server is launched.


Why I'm writing this one?
Honestly, I have used a better one, but due to the policy of my company, I can't take it out, so nobody can use it out of my company, 
I've search many times on the internet, they are mostly very simple or need to pay for it.
The truth is I(we) really need a common socket simulator with highly customizable.
